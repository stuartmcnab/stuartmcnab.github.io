Welcome to my new blog! I'm excited to share my thoughts on web technology, AI, and software engineering.

## How This Works

This blog is powered by Jekyll and GitHub Pages. I can write posts in Google Docs, export them to Markdown, and simply drop them in the `_posts` folder. GitHub Pages automatically builds and deploys the site.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Web Development**: Modern frameworks, best practices, and emerging technologies
- **AI & Machine Learning**: Practical applications and industry trends
- **Software Engineering**: Architecture, design patterns, and productivity tips

Stay tuned for more content!
