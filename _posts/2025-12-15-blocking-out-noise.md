# Noisy AF

AF, Audio Frequency, Noise, there is lots of it, at various levels, cars, TV's, people.

These are the tools I use to block out those sounds, listed high to low:

## Active Noise Cancelling over ear headphone - Sony WH-1000XM4 £200

These replaced some Sony WH-900N headphones that after years of use had a failure of one of the noise cancelling microphones which made them crackle. Unfortunately at the time it was too difficult to work out what parts I needed to replace to fix them.

Whilst the newer XM5 model was out, they did not have favorable reviews on durability and were heavily software controlled, so I purchased the XM4.

They are fairly common in the world of over ear headphones, and have been solid for blocking out noise on my occasional commutes, in busy WeWork hot desk areas, or when I just need to focus more at home.

Work well without music if its not too loud, music helps cover up the noise when in busier places.

## Active Noise Cancelling earphones - Sony WF-C700N £70

These replaced some One Plus Buds Pro that had a similar fault to the WH-900N's where the noise cancelling microphone failed. They were out of warranty and tiny, so they were sent for recycling.

I already had the WH-1000XM4 earphones, so I just wanted a solid pair of earphones, that could noise cancel and fit in my pocket if I was out and about, for music, or to take the edge off sound.

They work really well, recently I have been using them at home with transparency mode to listen to lofi youtube video's as I work.

## Earplugs - Loop Dream (for sleeping) £40

I had used the Loop Experience (below) earplugs here and there at night, and found they took the edge off traffic noise, or neighbors etc and helped my sleep.

Unfortunately the Loop Experience earplugs being hard, did press into my ear when I was sleeping on my side, and as I had had good experience with Loop, and foam 3M E.A.R. earplugs in the past, the Loop Dreams seemed a good choice.

My wife and I got them on a deal, I think 25% off, and they are really good. The standard foam tips are comfortable, and the rubber 'loop' parts don't press into your ear, or transfer any sound from contact with a pillow.

I've had much better sleep wearing these and as they are easy to clean I see myself using them for a long time.

## Earplugs - Loop Experience (for concerts, loud environments) £30

As I mentioned above, whilst I have used these to sleep, they were primarily purchased to replace some Alpine PartyPlug earplugs for concerts (the alpines felt too deep in my ear), these popped up on an influencer channel my wife watches on YouTube.

They work well to block general sound, but you can still have a conversation at normal sound levels (takes some getting used to).

The biggest test was at Wembley Stadium for the Taylor Swift Era's tour, my wife and I both wore them and taking one out to test the sound felt deafening.

For smaller concerts, they stop the weird sound feeling you get after the concert, and for someone who already has tinnitus for a youth where I liked to be near the front (and the loud speakers) I'm hoping these reduce any further damage.

## Ear defenders - 3M Peltor 1 Bulls Eye £15

I can be sensitive to sound, and I chose these partly due to the nostalgia of wearing them on a rifle range as an Air Cadet.

They do a good job of blocking sudden sounds out, as you would expect from something designed to help with rifle shots.

I like them to take the edge off and help me focus when I don't want music, or the gentle hiss of noise cancelling headphones.

3M seems to lead the way in ear defenders, and they offer different levels, the 1 in Peltor 1 signifying the lowest level in this range, I think it goes up to 3.

## Summary

There are lots of ways to block out sounds, hopefully seeing the way I do it will help you on your journey.
