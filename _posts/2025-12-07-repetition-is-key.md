# TL;DR

This week I powered down one of my two Meshtastic node, which leaves one, that doesn't see any other nodes.

## Radio

### Meshtastic

Whilst I might have some future Meshtastic projects in the new year, perhaps testing and building antenna's, testing loft positioning, and outdoors to see if that makes any difference.

### TinyGS

I have TinyGS on my todo list, it uses 433MHZ to capture packets from passing (mostly small cube) satellites. Whilst this might do better with some custom antennas its in the project list.

433MHZ has a lot of noise locally too, so this might require a filter to optimise.

## Repetition

I'm writing this blog late, but I'm still writing it. I don't hit my calorie goal every day, but I do hit it a lot. I don't make all of my gym workout targets, but I still keep going.

The more I do it, the more it becomes habit, and the more those good things happen the more my habits are good.

I had a bad weekend when it comes to food, but the food made me feel good. It was worth it, I'll be back on routine again tomorrow.
